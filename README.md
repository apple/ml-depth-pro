We present a foundation model for zero-shot metric monocular depth estimation. Our model, Depth Pro, synthesizes high-resolution depth maps with unparalleled sharpness and high-frequency details. The predictions are metric, with absolute scale, without relying on the availability of metadata such as camera intrinsics. And the model is fast, producing a 2.25-megapixel depth map in 0.3 seconds on a standard GPU ‚è±Ô∏è. These characteristics are enabled by a number of technical contributions, including an efficient multi-scale vision transformer for dense prediction, a training protocol that combines real and synthetic datasets to achieve high metric accuracy alongside fine boundary tracing, dedicated evaluation metrics for boundary accuracy in estimated depth maps, and state-of-the-art focal length estimation from a single image üîç.


The model in this repository is a reference implementation, which has been re-trained. Its performance is close to the model reported in the paper but does not match it exactly.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

We recommend setting up a virtual environment. Using e.g. miniconda, the `depth_pro` package can be installed via:

```bash
conda create -n depth-pro -y python=3.9
conda activate depth-pro

pip install -e .
```

To download pretrained checkpoints follow the code snippet below:
```bash
source get_pretrained_models.sh   # Files will be downloaded to `checkpoints` directory.
```

### üíª Running from command line

We provide a helper script to directly run the model on a single image:
```bash
# Run prediction on a single image:
depth-pro-run -i ./data/example.jpg
# Run `depth-pro-run -h` for available options.
```

### üêç Running from python

```python
from PIL import Image
import depth_pro

# Load model and preprocessing transform
model, transform = depth_pro.create_model_and_transforms()
model.eval()

# Load and preprocess an image.
image, _, f_px = depth_pro.load_rgb(image_path)
image = transform(image)

# Run inference.
prediction = model.infer(image, f_px=f_px)
depth = prediction["depth"]  # Depth in [m].
focallength_px = prediction["focallength_px"]  # Focal length in pixels.
```


### üìä Evaluation (boundary metrics) 

Our boundary metrics can be found under `eval/boundary_metrics.py` and used as follows:

```python
# for a depth-based dataset
boundary_f1 = SI_boundary_F1(predicted_depth, target_depth)

# for a mask-based dataset (image matting / segmentation) 
boundary_recall = SI_boundary_Recall(predicted_depth, target_mask)
```
